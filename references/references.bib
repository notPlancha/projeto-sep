    abstract = "{Facial recognition technology is just one of a suite of new digital tools police and other security providers around the world are adopting in an effort to function more safely and efficiently. This paper reports results from a major new London-based study exploring public responses to Live Facial Recognition (LFR): a technology that enables police to carry out real-time automated identity checks in public spaces. We find that public trust and legitimacy are important factors predicting the acceptance or rejection of LFR. Crucially, trust and, particularly, legitimacy seem to serve to alleviate privacy concerns about police use of this technology. In an era where police use of new technologies is only likely to increase, especially as the Covid-19 global pandemic develops, these findings have important implications for police-public relations and how the 'public voice' is fed into debates.}",

In a speech last month, she branded critics of the technology as “highly inaccurate or highly ill-informed” and said concerns about people's images passing through LFR were “much, much smaller” than the need to stop citizens “being knifed in the chest”.}

abstract = {Governments around the world are adopting facial recognition technology (FRT) to improve public services and law enforcement. Past research has shown that such applications may result in discriminatory effects and threaten privacy. This study shines light on the question of what drives public opinion regarding FRT in different socio-political contexts. Based on an online survey and semi-structured interviews, this study finds that citizens in China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States differ in their acceptance of the official public use of FRT. China has the highest approval rates, Germany and the US have the lowest, and the UK lies in the middle. Our results show that people are generally more willing to accept FRT in public spheres when they trust government institutions, believe the technology should be managed by the central government, and have an affinity for technology. People's awareness of a country's previous history of surveillance further shapes their perceptions of FRT. Across all four countries, we also show that privacy concerns, especially of FRT compromising one's privacy, have the biggest influence on respondents' attitudes. Expanding on existing research into FRT acceptance and usage, our results suggest that policymakers urgently need to address the current regulatory vacuum.}

abstract = {The Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) is used to match a photo of a person's face through a database that contains picture, name, and other records of someone that are already in the database. This technology uses biometric data with other available information and provides precise and accurate information about a person and his behaviour. FRT has positioned itself significantly advanced among all biometric-based technologies. The use of FRT by government agencies and commercial organisation comes under scrutiny as many of them use the technology in violation of right to privacy where the data subjects are either not informed of data collection or not consented for the data collection, use or storage of their data. Privation of regulatory measures allows government agencies and commercial organisations to operate with no real legal restraint and only under limited self-regulation in many common law countries. The research focuses on suitability of the existing law to regulate the use of FRT by analysing the criminal law and the civil law including the privacy laws in few common law countries. The analysis of the laws shows that passing of appropriate laws is inevitable as the existing laws are inadequate to regulate the use of FRT by government and commercial organisations.}

    abstract = { Facial recognition has become one of the most widely discussed technology solutions in recent years. Advocates such as myself point to its ability to make us all safer, to offer added convenience to users and to underpin operational efficiencies. Meanwhile critics tend to fall into one of two camps. They either claim it doesn't work, or conversely that it is an invasion of privacy and therefore a threat to society. Some of the concerns about how the technology is to be deployed are valid. However, history has almost always shown that those who seek to stand in the way of technological advancement find themselves on the wrong side of the debate. }
